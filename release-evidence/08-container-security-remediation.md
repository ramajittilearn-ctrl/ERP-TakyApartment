# Container security remediation — 2026-10-26

## Scope

This candidate refreshes the Node runtime and PostgreSQL bases to pinned Node 22.23.4 Trixie and PostgreSQL 17.11 Trixie OCI index digests. The operations image also pins rclone 1.75.2 by its OCI index digest. The app runtime invokes the bundled Prisma and tsx CLIs directly, allowing global npm/npx to be removed from app and validator images. The operations derivative removes its inherited `gosu`; it uses `ENTRYPOINT []` and runs Node/PostgreSQL client commands directly. The actual PostgreSQL service image retains `gosu` because the official entrypoint requires it.

Operator instructions, remediation harness commands, and compose test/restore images were updated to match these runtime paths and digests. The bulk `node_modules` copy remains root-owned and readable to the unprivileged runtime user; it no longer recursively changes ownership during image assembly.

## Source verification

- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm test`: 422/422 passed across 36 files.
- `npm run test:ops`: 86/86 passed.
- `npm run lint`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed with Next.js 16.4.1.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Independent Pstack review by `independent_release_audit` confirmed the base digests, gosu scope, and direct CLI paths. Its initial findings about stale integration-test commands and unpinned rclone were corrected; reviewer recheck is pending.

These checks validate the source tree, not a successful runtime for all new images.

## Container checks and current limits

- `taky-phase4-validator:security-review` built successfully for `linux/arm64`. Docker Scout reported 0 Critical, 1 High, 0 Medium, and 0 Low findings. The remaining High finding is Debian Trixie's `zlib` package, CVE-2026-85091, with no fixed version listed by the scanner.
- `taky-phase4-operations:security-review` built successfully for `linux/arm64` from the pinned Node, PostgreSQL and rclone sources, with `gosu` removed from this derivative. The Docker Scout scan ended with `unexpected EOF`; no vulnerability verdict is claimed for this image.
- The app image build completed the Next production build, then failed while copying all `node_modules` because Docker Desktop returned `input/output error` while changing file ownership. Removing recursive ownership changes was followed by a retry, which failed when containerd could not write its metadata database (`meta.db: input/output error`). No app image runtime or final-image scan is verified.
- At the time of failure, the host data volume reported 3.2 GB available (99% used). Docker could not retrieve the image list or `docker system df` because its metadata database returned the same I/O error. No prune, reset, volume deletion, or changes to the running UAT stack were attempted.

The Docker engine/storage condition must be repaired using a verified safe process before further image operations. Preserve existing UAT databases and volumes. After recovery, rebuild all three exact images, scan each image (and separately scan the actual database service image), then run exact-image app, validator, backup/restore, and agent UAT checks. The candidate remains **NO-GO** for production.
